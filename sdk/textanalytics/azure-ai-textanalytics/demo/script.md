# Our script

We are coders at a fictional hospital, and we are tasked with automatically extracting patient information from medical history forms.
We will be using Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services to parse our medical history forms. Specifically we're going to be looking into
Azure's Form Recognizer and Text Analytics services and using our Python Client libraries to better access the services.
